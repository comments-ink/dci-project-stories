You can play an important role by helping spread the word about Net Neutrality, meeting face to face with elected officials and urging them to protect the open Internet.\r\n\r\nYou can start by urging the Senate to stand up for Net Neutrality.",

Nuclear weapons need large facilities, but genetic engineering can be done in a small lab. You can't regulate every lab in the world. The danger is that either by accident or design, we create a virus that destroys us.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space. There are too many accidents that can befall life on a single planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.\"",
